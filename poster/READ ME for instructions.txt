%==================== Poster version 2021 ETH Corporate Identity ==================

Dear user

We have made these poster templates as easy to use as possible (not everyone using these templates has a degree in informatics or wants to spend hours of rethinking or google-ing the right commands. ;-) )

SO, depending on what you want to do, all you need are the following files:
==========

1. Poster-content.tex 

This is the file where you insert all your text, figures, tables, etc. Here you can choose the background color of your poster (line 28), adjust (if necessary) the size of your text, etc. The text boxes are dynamic, i.e. if your text in box 1 is getting longer, then the text box below will move downwards. So keep an eye on a useful text length in all boxes. 



2. The setting file

a) Poster with white background
either landscape = Poster-landscape-white.tex
or portrait      = Poster-portrait-white.tex

OR 

b) Poster with coloured background
either landscape = Poster-landscape-color.tex
or portrait      = Poster-portrait-color.tex

3. your own bib.file, if you use bibtex for your references
==========
